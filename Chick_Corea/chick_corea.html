        <h3>Who is he?</h3>
        <p>Armando Anthony "Chick" Corea (June 12, 1941 – February 9, 2021) was an American jazz composer, keyboardist, bandleader, and occasional percussionist. His compositions ."Spain", "500 Miles High", "La Fiesta", "Armando's Rhumba" and "Windows" are widely considered <strong>jazz standards</strong>. As a member of Miles Davis's band in the late 1960s, he participated in the birth of jazz fusion. In the 1970s he formed Return to Forever. Along with Herbie Hancock, McCoy Tyner, Keith Jarrett and Bill Evans, he is considered one of the foremost jazz pianists of the post-John Coltrane era.</p>

        <h4>Cheeky</h4>
        <p id="description">Armando Anthony Corea was called cheeky by his aunt, everytime she met him, when he was a kid. Chick was named after his own father, Armando, who was a trumpetist, bassist and composer from italian origin that was active in the Boston music scene between the 30s and 40s, playing a more modern style of dixieland music. </br></br>
  Chick got his first piano when he was only <strong> 4 years old</strong> and got his first lessons from his father, who taught him musical literacy and wrote new arrangements for popular songs so little Chick could understand and get intimate with musical language.

        <h4>Classical Background</h4>
        <p>Around 11 years old, Chick started taking classes with <strong>Salvatore Sullo</strong>, a respected concertist that also lived in Boston.
          He was presented with the erudite repertoir of Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart and Scarlatti.
          Later, he was presented to the work of his contemporaries <strong>Bártok, Stravinsky and Erik Satie</strong>, his favorites of the genre.

        <h4>Early Days</h4>
        <p>
          At home, he listened to jazz, especially those of the masters
          Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, and the modern
          big band led by Billy Eckstine. When he was in College, 
          his father took him to play with him in parties and balls
          , and some time after that, he could already get some money
          on wedding and <i>bar mitvahs</i> gigs.
